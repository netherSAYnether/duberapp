# duberapp

The mission of the Duber project is to end the artificial scarcity of weed.

What is it? Isn't that iLleGaL?

I don't know, I'm not a lawyer. But here's the idea: Duber as a contributer-owned network of cannabis growers and consumers. Neither Duber nor any of our Duber Comrades sell or trade cannabis. Want to receive a complimentary Dubie from a nearby Duber grower? Want it delivered by drone? Of course you do. Join the Duber family and receive the means of production! 

This project is open source, and any input, additions, or code fixes are appreciated.
