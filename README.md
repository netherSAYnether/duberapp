The mission of the Duber project is to end the artificial scarcity of weed.

What is it? Isn't that iLleGaL?

I don't know, I'm not a lawyer. But here's the idea: Duber as a contributer-owned network of cannabis growers and consumers. Neither Duber nor any of our Duber Comrades sell or trade cannabis. Want to receive a complimentary Dubie from a nearby Duber grower? Want it delivered by an autonomous drone? Of course you do. Join the Duber family and receive the means of production! A state-of-the-art grow set-up, a potentially generous weekly income, a Duber Drone, and a dedicated support team.

Included are Java and XML files from Android Studio for the Duber app. The concept is similar to that of a certain ride-sharing app, only with weed. It is currently in development, and won't be ready for deployment until around the new year. This project is completely open source, and any input, additions, or code fixes are appreciated. There is also a website under development at the following domain: https://duberapp.org
